How to setup a typescript + nodejs project

#### Prerequisites

1. Have node and npm installed
2. Familiar with Node and the npm ecosystem 
3. Code editor installed(preferrably VS Code)

Typescript(JavaScript that scales) -> superset of javacript

TS solves two problems
-> Provide JS developers with an optional type system (having the compiler help catch bugs and validate types)
-> Provide JS developers with the ability to utilize planned features from future JS editions against current JS engines


#### Initial Setup

`npm init -y`

Note : Using the -y flag when creating a package.json will simply approve all the defaults.
